# Aim

To develop random puzzle generation in an interesting way

## Mechanics

### Automation

Why is automation so interesting? Because it allows you to turn repeated actions into things which can be reused without effort - it is the perfect form of progression. Because of this, the player is free to do more than one action at a time which can make the player "super-human".

#### What sort of tasks can automation do?

Automation could solve simple tasks and complex tasks. The more complex the task the harder the AI has to be and the less reward that the player gets for automating the process as they have reduced control over the simulation.

#### What menial tasks are there?

1. Slow burners - things which take a lot of repetitive actions to reach a goal e.g. defeating a boss
2. Regular revival - things which are quick but have to happen frequently e.g. recharging health
3.
